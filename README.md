# Fast-Motion-Estimation-Implementation-for-H.265-HEVC
While H.265 video compression produces small file sizes, its encoding speed is extremely slow. Project involves modifying the official H.265 code, replacing the original complex search algorithm with a simpler geometric search algorithm (diamond search). The goal is to increase compression speed  while maintaining almost the same image quality.
